Several files supporting GNU-style builds are copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, and carry a different license from that given
below.  The files included in the libatomic_ops distribution (included
here) use either the license below, or a similar MIT-style license,
or, for some files not actually used by the garbage-collector library, the
GPL.

THIS MATERIAL IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED.  ANY USE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Permission is hereby granted to use or copy this program
for any purpose,  provided the above notices are retained on all copies.
Permission to modify the code and to distribute modified code is granted,
provided the above notices are retained, and a notice that the code was
modified is included with the above copyright notice.

A few of the files needed to use the GNU-style build procedure come with
slightly different licenses, though they are all similar in spirit.  A few
are GPL'ed, but with an exception that should cover all uses in the
collector. (If you are concerned about such things, I recommend you look
at the notice in config.guess or ltmain.sh.)

The atomic_ops library contains some code that is covered by the GNU General
Public License, but is not needed by, nor linked into the collector library.
It is included here only because the atomic_ops distribution is, for
simplicity, included in its entirety.
